## 1. Overview of *classroom-assignments* <a name="heading--1"/>
A single repository to rule them all. Placed here are all of the programming assignments I've done previously during my undergraduate years at UoM Dearborn.
I've organized them in terms of the respective class they were a part of and ordered these classes in terms of their recency.

## 2. Operating Systems (Winter 2021) <a name="heading--2"/>
For this course I was tasked with running xv6, an educational operating system, in a container using Docker to virtualize the process.
All of the code written and modified was made in C in visual studio and ran/tested in a directory that both my host machine and xv6cp container could access.


### Getting Docker Running

Follow the instructions from Docker's main website in order to properly install their software on your preferred operating system:
